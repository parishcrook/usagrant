        <p class="article-text">
            Government grants are monetary allotments from the US Government awarded to certain individuals who formally apply and are deemed eligible. These grants are given at the local, state, and federal levels of government. Government grants can be sought after and used for a variety of purposes such as to pay off debt, start a business, pay college tuition, etc. If you could use some extra cash for a legitimate reason that would inevitably increase the quality of your life in some manner, you may want to consider applying for a government grant.<br>
           <br> One of the most appealing characteristics of government grants is that the recipient is not required to pay it back. No debt is incurred upon receiving a grant. It is not a loan, so it does not involve revenue sharing, direct appropriation, interest rate subsidy, loan guarantees, or any other form of technical assistance. If an applicant receives an award, that money then fully belongs to the recipient at which point they would then use the money for the intended purpose as stated in the application process. The reason the government awards grants is because they are interested in economic stimulation and are willing to allocate funds to certain individuals if they believe that the personâ€™s use of said money will advocate for economic growth in some way, either locally or nationally.<br>
          <br>  In order to find out if you are eligible for a government grant, you will need to formally apply which you can do here at www.governmentgrants.us. The specifics of your current life status, particularly aspects that can be sympathized with or that set you apart in some way, are the things that will increase your chances of being awarded a grant more than anything else. An income that is below the national average, a divorced marital status, a single parent with multiple dependents, a cancer survivor, a victim of abuse, lots of debt; these are examples of characteristics that can increase your chances of being a government grant recipient. Your eligibility, however, does not have to be based solely on seemingly unfortunate life circumstances. Things like aspiring to be the first member of your family to graduate from college, being a minority, being a female, or simply desiring to get your business idea off the ground are just some of the additional things that can increase the probability of receiving a grant.<br>
           <br> Government grants are given out in a variety of different amounts and for a variety of different reasons. Let us help you get started to see what government grants you qualify for!
